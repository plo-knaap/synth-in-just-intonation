Original description:
Final project. I wanted to make an instrument, that could play in just intonation, as it is more in tune than regular tuning, and as such should sound better. A regular piano can not be tuned in this fashion, nor can this be exactly played like a regular piano; the idea was more about to create a new instrument with a familiar input method. I added the frequency spectrum circles, as they visualise the pulsating sound that can be heard with slightly out of tune harmonies, which this insument highlights.
